  "description" : "Most pilots start their careers in the Sidewinder. It is a classic ship design that has been in use (in various configurations) since 2982. Its original design was a light support ship and it lacked jump capability. Modern compact drives have enabled jump-capable versions to be created, making this a useful all rounder. Some navies still use these ships as fighters and patrol craft.",
